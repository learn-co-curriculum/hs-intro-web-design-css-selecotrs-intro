So far, we've learned about basic CSS selectors. We can add styling to all `h1` tags, by using `h1` as our selector. We can even style just one HTML element by adding an ID, or the same styling to multiple HTML element by using classes. We've learned how important selectors are. Without them, our pages wouldn't look nearly so good. Now it's time to dive in a little more deeply to learn about advanced selectors:

+ Descendant selectors (child,  sibling, precendent)
+ Pseudo selectors
+ Universal selector
+ Attribute selectors
+ Compound selectors
